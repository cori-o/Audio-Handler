# Audio-Handler 
End-to-end audio processing pipeline for denoising, VAD, and speaker diarization.

Audio-Handler is a modular pipeline for audio preprocessing and voice analysis.
It performs:

- Noise suppression
- Dereverberation
- Frequency filtering
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- Speaker diarization

This project is designed to prepare clean and structured audio for downstream speech applications such as ASR, speaker identification, and transcription systems.
