# Audio-Handler 
End-to-end audio processing pipeline for denoising, VAD, and speaker diarization.

Audio-Handler is an end-to-end audio preprocessing and analysis pipeline.
It includes noise suppression, dereverberation, frequency filtering, voice activity detection (VAD), and speaker diarization.
Designed for clean and structured speech processing, it serves as a foundational module for downstream voice AI applications such as speech recognition, speaker identification, and transcription systems.
